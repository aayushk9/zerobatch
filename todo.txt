TODOs

- make sure all api endpoints are authenticated using sessions
- prisma operations at all api endpoints
- render users at beta users for founder
- frontend (from scratch)

2 THINGS TO CONSIDER

- Attach SESSION ID to FOUNDER when they generate link       (session id comes from auth)
- Attach SESSION ID to FOUNDER when they request beta users  

-- users are submitting to correct startup? how to VERIFY?
    GENERATE a slug (unique) and ask user to enter that slug when joining waitlist, add ID to that slug and save startupId (beta user) as slugID
    

-- FRONTEND PAGES

1. /auth-page 
2. /dashboard (for generating a link) and button to render beta users    [AUTHENTICATED ROUTE]
3. /betausers (to render list of users subscribed)   [AUTHENTICATED ROUTE] 
4. /beta-request (for user)
